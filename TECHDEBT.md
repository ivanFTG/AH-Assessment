* Update the white background launch screen that is shown at the start of the app, before the List screen for something more aligned with the app style.
* The parsing of DetailModel needs a re-review to make sure parsing is legible and easy to understand.
* Animations on the List screen are missing and the replacing of place holders and cell updates are a little junky.
* When scrolling really fast there seems to be a problem of Task cancellation for the cell loading tasks. I need to control this.
